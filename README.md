# Welcome to My Zsh
***

## Task
The task is to implement the Zsh in Debian and Linux. But this program is less functional than the original one.

## Description
Zsh is the shell to perform various commands like running programs and creating an environment.

## Installation
There is a Makefile file to build the binary and make things easier. After pulling and installing it,
if you are using Linux or Debian, write make and everything is done automatically. If you are using Windows you have to make it using GCC.

## Usage
After building the binary file, you run it. After that, you use it as a regular Zsh. It has commands like cd, ls, touch and which, etc.
```
./my_zsh
```
